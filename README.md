This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## About Mark3

Mark3 is a cutting-edge platform designed to revolutionize how trademarks are registered and managed. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology and Story Protocol, Mark3 provides a secure, transparent, and globally accessible solution for:

*   **On-Chain Trademark Registration:** Creating immutable records of trademark ownership.
*   **Simplified IP Management:** Offering tools to manage and license trademark assets directly on the blockchain.
*   **Enhanced Brand Protection:** Providing robust proof of ownership and tools to combat infringement in the Web3 era.

Our goal is to make trademark registration more efficient, cost-effective, and accessible to creators, entrepreneurs, and businesses worldwide.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Understanding Trademark Registration Challenges

Registering a trademark is a crucial step for businesses to protect their brand identity. However, the process can present several challenges, particularly highlighted by global and regional statistics, as well as national-level data.

### Global and Regional Disparities in Trademark Filings

ðŸ“Š **Latin America's Share in Trademark Registration**
According to data from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), in 2021 (note: the provided text mentions 2023, but the WIPO article is from 2022 referring to 2021 data), Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for approximately 8.7% of global trademark applications when combining Africa, Latin America & Caribbean, and Oceania. In stark contrast, Asia concentrated 67.6% of these applications, reflecting a significant disparity in trademark registration activity between regions. _(Source: [WIPO Press Room, 2022](https://www.wipo.int/pressroom/es/articles/2022/article_0013.html))_

*Self-correction: The provided text mentioned Latin America and the Caribbean represented 7.1% in 2023. The WIPO article from November 2022 discusses 2021 data. For 2021, Asia's share of applications was 67.6%. The share for offices in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania combined was 8.7%. The 7.1% figure is not directly present for Latin America alone in the summary table for 2021, but the general disparity is clear.*

### National-Level Challenges: The Case of Mexico

ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ **Mexico's Trademark Scenario**
In Mexico, during 2023, a total of 210,922 trademark applications were filed with the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI). Out of these, 146,901 were accepted, while 64,021 were rejected. This represents a rejection rate of approximately 30.35%. Such a high rejection percentage indicates that a significant portion of applications do not result in successful registration, either due to errors in the application process or failure to meet the required criteria.

### Economic Consequences of Not Registering Trademarks

The failure to register trademarks can lead to several negative economic implications for businesses, especially for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs:

*   **Loss of Exclusivity:** Without formal registration, it is difficult to claim exclusive rights over a brand, potentially allowing third parties to use it without authorization.
*   **Risk of Infringement:** Competitors might register a similar or identical trademark, which could force the original company to rebrand, incurring associated costs.
*   **Legal Difficulties:** In the event of disputes, the lack of registration complicates the legal defense of rights over the trademark.
*   **Loss of Brand Value:** An unregistered trademark may be perceived as less reliable or professional, which can affect consumer perception and, consequently, sales.

Understanding these challenges is key to appreciating the value of streamlined and accessible on-chain intellectual property registration solutions like Mark3, which aims to simplify and secure this process.
